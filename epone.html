<div class="story-format">

<p> Mama Reni’s, nestled on the corner of Market and Main Street in downtown McArthur, Ohio, 
is the kind of hometown pizza shop where locals who have lived here in Vinton County for decades 
gather to reminisce about the good days, the past. </p>

<p> McArthur has always been a small town, nestled in the woods of Southeastern Ohio. Never have more than 2,000 people lived here at once. 
And for Bob Grillo, it’s a sports town. The county juvenile court judge helps run youth sports leagues in Vinton County. He knows McArthur like the back of his wrinkled hand. </p>

<p> “And here’s a picture of our only state champion we’ve had in cross country. I think he actually won it twice," Grillo said. "We had a great group of runners back in the day. We still do.” </p>

<p> Grillo points to a black and white picture of a skinny runner with wavy brown hair, the word “Vikings” emblazoned across his uniform. 
Mitch Beasely. Ran 2 and a half miles in a then state meet record 12 minutes and three point four seconds for first place in 1980. </p>

<p> Mama Reni’s is full of these pictures and posters documenting Vinton County athletic glory. 
You almost feel like you’re in a museum. Faded pics of football players, basketball players who have moved away or passed away. </p>

<p> Most locals know about people like Beasely. But on the far wooden wall hangs a picture of a baseball player whose name only old-timers like Grillo could tell you. 
And when Grillo gathers local kids to play baseball, he does just that.</p>

<p> “I usually go 'how many people have played Division 1 football from here?' And they usually say 20. And I go it’s actually two: one got a scholarship and another got a naval appointment. 
I ask 'how many people have gone on to Division I basketball?' And they usually say 50. The answer is none. And I go 'how many people have played Major League Baseball?' And they say none. The answer is actually one, 
and it’s actually Dickey Bates. Then I go tell them the story of Dickey Bates of how he made it to the majors, and everyone goes ‘that’s pretty cool.'” </p>

<h2> A "Sports Town" </h2>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 10px;"> <em>Above: McArthur High School's former baseball field, the same field Dick practiced and played on growing up.</em> </h5>

<p> Unlike some pictures of players on Mama Reni’s walls, the 72-year-old Dick Bates is still around. Just not in McArthur, and not in Ohio. </p>

<p> "I’m the general manager of the Arizona Biltmore Golf Courses. I’ve been there for about 28 years, so. I’ve been out in Arizona since 1969,” Bates said. </p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="http://i63.tinypic.com/25utbu9.jpg" alt="Credit: Arizona Biltmore Golf Club" /></span>Dick stands tall with wispy white hair and a toothy smile. He hasn’t lived in McArthur for decades since his childhood. But today’s McArthur and the McArthur of old still share priorities. <em> (Side: A more current picture of Dick Bates, taken at his work at the Arizona Biltmore Golf Club (Credit - Arizona Biltmore Golf Club)) </em> </p>

<p> Dick stands tall with wispy white hair and a toothy smile. He hasn’t lived in McArthur for decades since his childhood. But today’s McArthur and the McArthur of old still share priorities. </p>

<p> “Sports -- that was about it. You played sports in McArthur. There wasn’t much else to do around," Bates said. "But I played all three sports: football, basketball, and baseball. 
Back then, McArthur was geared around sports and stuff like that, so. You had a bunch of kids that moved in from West Virginia to play sports. It was a good sports town." </p>

<p> One of Dick’s first introductions to sports was when one evening as a kid, his dad, Austin Bates, came home from work at the Austin Powder Company and handed him a baseball glove. </p>

<p> “We were together all the time. He started me out really young. 
He bought me my first baseball glove and we’d go out into the yard and throw baseball about every night. 
He coached our premier league team. And he coached me all the way through little league and stuff like that.” </p>

<p> By the time he entered the halls of McArthur High School as a freshman in 1960, the 205-pound Bates was already a starting varsity player for the football, basketball and baseball team. </p>

<p>“He was a good football player. I mean, he tackled, punted, kicked off," Ron Fenik, Dick's former high school football coach, said. "He could have played a lot of positions. 
When we needed to tackle someone, we just put him there. He was just a good athlete.”</p>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 10px;"> <em>Above: Ron Fenik stands on McArthur High School's former football field.</em> </h5>

<p> The McArthur High Generals won multiple Vinton County championships in basketball and were competitive in football with Dick Bates being one of leaders. 
Bates even received honorable mentions for the All-Ohio football and basketball teams. 
But his real talent always came back to the baseball diamond. </p>

<p> "[Dick] just looked so smooth throwing the ball. And he made it look like he wasn’t even trying throwing really coming in there.
His dad was smart in baseball. I could remember it would be in February, there’d be snow on the ground, and he’d be out there throwing 50 pitches or something and he’d be catching. 
But his dad could pick out every little thing wrong. Now where he got his knowledge, I don’t know. But he was impressive.” </p>

<p> Just as he did when Dick was growing up, almost every single night during high school Austin Bates and Dick would walk 500 feet from their their Pearl Street home to the ballpark to work on pitching. </p>

<p> “He was really persistent, and he really wanted you to work. 
He would make me run and work on my pitches and stuff like that," Dick said. 
"If he didn’t stay on me and stuck with me for as long as he did, I probably wouldn’t be as good as I was.” </p>

<p> His parents, Austin and Zella, went to see every one of his games. And when they saw him in the diamond, he threw <em>fire</em>. 
During his freshman year, he struck out 50 batters in 100 innings. 
Multiple games he would fan 13 hitters, 16 hitters per game. 
Local media was claiming he was one the “best scholastic pitchers in Southeastern Ohio.” </p>

<p> Dick even threw two no-hitters in the span of a week his junior year. For a small place like McArthur, the big leagues eventually came calling. </p>

<h2> Growing Up Baseball </h2>

<img src="http://i66.tinypic.com/nfi1qe.png" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 10px;"> <em>Above: A news clip detailing Dick Bates signing a minor league deal with the Washington Senators (Credit: The McArthur Republican-Tribune, Vol. 68 No. 26, June 25, 1964, pg. 1 col. 3) </em> </h5>

<p> At regional baseball tournaments around Ohio, scouts saw Dick's potential. </p>

<p> “Well, the Pittsburgh Pirates looked at me. The Washington Senators were looking at me, and the Cincinnati Reds were looking at me in High School. 
So,  I signed the day after I graduated high school with the Washington Senators," Dick said. 
"It happened so quick, because I graduated, I signed and I was gone. 
There was no parties or anything like that. My parents didn’t have a party. 
But it happened so quick that you don’t really have time to think about it.” </p>

<p> Dick didn’t have time to say goodbye to friends. He barely had time to say goodbye to his parents. 
He left for Wytheville, Virginia for the rookie-ball league a few days after graduation in 1964. </p>

<p> “I was scared. Being 18-years-old and never had been to much of the country. 
I learned how to cook myself. You grew up fast. 
I was the youngest guy on the team, most of the guys on the team were college graduates." </p>

<p> As Dick moved from one team across the country to another, his parents still kept in touch. </p>

<p> “Every year they’d make a trip down to North Carolina and they’d spend two weeks when we were in town for a week and stuff like that. 
And they’d even come to Charlotte when I played in the Carolina league and stuff too.” </p>

<p> It was during his time with the Double AA team Savannah Senators in 1968 when Dick really came into his own. 
He set a then Southern League record pitching 32 consecutive scoreless innings, even pitching against a team managed by former Cincinnati Reds manager Sparky Anderson. </p>

<p> “Sparky Anderson was the guy that actually got me in the expansion draft. 
I pitched against his team in Asheville and got to know him, and he’s the one that really got me drafted by the Seattle Pilots. 
He’s the one that put the word out for me.” </p>

<p> The city of Seattle finally for the first time had a major league baseball team in 1969 as one of two expansion teams in Major League Baseball that year. 
Dick was drafted 15th in the expansion draft. And he was headed to Tempe, Arizona for spring training. </p>

<p> He was surrounded by baseball players he had seen on TV: Tommy Harper, Joe Pepitone and Jim Bouton, the man who would later publish the famous baseball book “Ball Four.” </p>

<p> But it wasn’t meant to be. </p> 

<p> Dick was the last player cut on the Seattle Pilots roster before the start of the season. He was sent back down to the Triple-AAA team up in Vancouver. </p>

<p> “It was tough, because I had probably the best spring of all pitchers," Dick said. "I was very disappointed. 
Because I had felt that I had pitched well enough to make the team.” </p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/2mwrtz5.jpg" alt="" /></span>It was late in April when Dick was pitching against the Hawaiian Islanders in Honolulu, and the famous Hawaiian pop singer Don Ho was in the stands that afternoon.
“He had come to the game, and watched the game. And he invited us down to have a drink and stuff," Dick said.</p>

<p> Dick and grabs his buddies that night and head to Don Ho’s bar in downtown Honolulu. 
He was drinking around 11pm that night when their manager, Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Lemon, barges into the bar. </p>

<p> “And I was kind of shocked. He said I had to get on a plane to Seattle tonight. So being a small-town boy out of McArthur, Ohio, it was quite a thrill to be called up to the big leagues," Dick said. </p> 

<h2> April 27, 1969 </h2>

<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/2lcvk2b.jpg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 10px;"> <em>Above: A snippet of one of the few baseball cards made of Dick Bates' career</em></h5>

<p> Bates' flight got into Seattle early that morning. The game was at noon that day in Sick’s Stadium against the Oakland Athletics. He couldn’t sleep. And April 27th, 1969 would be his first day in the Big Leagues. </p>

<p> “I remembered I was tired and stuff going to the ballpark. 
And I remember Bob told me I wasn’t going to pitch. 
Because I had just pitched the night before," Bates said." </p>

<p> “I was just sitting in the bullpen, because I had just finished running and stuff. And they called down and told me to get up and start warming up. Because they were like 'Hey, Bates, they just called your name to get up and start warming up.' 
You have no choice. You get up and start warming up.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/zjfkwl.gif" alt="" /></span>It was the top of the 6th inning. And the Seattle Pilots starting pitcher Mike Marshall was in trouble. 
He had just given up a three-run homer to future All-Star Sal Bando, and the Athletics were already up five to zero. No outs. 
The manager Frank Schultz wanted Dick out there instead. <em> (Side: Sick's Stadium in 1967 - Credit: Wikimedia Commons)</em></p>

<p> “They were the top team in the American League that year. I had a lot of butterflies when I first stepped out on the mound," Dick said. 
"McNerty was our catcher, and he more or less came out and said, I didn’t think you were going to be pitching.” </p>

<p> Dick stared down the first batter,  Danny Cater, a power-slugging 1st-baseman who received five MVP votes just last season.</p> 

<p> Dick walked him in five pitches. </p>

<p> The next batter was Rick Monday, an up-start center fielder who had his first All-Star season last year with the A’s. </p>

<p> “It was a fastball, and it was in the middle of the plate. And you don’t want to throw it in the middle of the plate,” Dick said. </p>

<p> Monday smacked it over the short, right-field fence for an opposite-field, two-run homerun. </p>

<p> “A pitcher knows when he makes a mistake. Or when he hangs a ball, or you pitch to where you know a guy where you shouldn’t pitch to him.” </p>

<p> Dick struck out the next two batters and got the third to groundout to the third baseman. But the damage was done. Seven to zero, Oakland. </p>

<p> In the top of the seventh inning with one out, Dick gives up two doubles in a row, scoring another three runs for Oakland. The lead balloons to ten-zip. Frank Schultz has seen enough, calling a new pitcher from the bullpen. </p>

<p> Five years of toiling in the minor leagues, traveling in dimly-lit buses, scraping by on the meager salary given to minor league players all led up to the dream of what this moment would be. 
A sleep-deprived, jet-lagged McArthur native walked out to the pitcher’s mound and threw the best he could given the circumstances. </p>

<p> He wanted another chance. But what Bates didn’t know was that it would be the last time he ever saw a Major League mound, on a team that would cease to exist by the next year. </p>
