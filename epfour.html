<p> 93-year-old Jack Riggs lives with his wife, Wilma, in a one-story ranch home in a subdivision that sits up atop Dogwood Ridge overlooking downtown Wheelersburg. </p>

<p> “Fred’s my name, but they've called me Jack since the first grade. I’m a lot different than I am now," Riggs said. </p>

<p> In 1968, Jack and his family to into Wheelersburg into a newly built home, Today, it’s inside walls display awards from Jack’s time as a youth pastor.  The inside of the home looks new as ever, awards hanging from the walls of Jack’s time as a Sunday school teacher. </p>

<p> This newly built home that Jack took out a loan to pay for in 1968 was in fact built twice within the span of a year. But the Riggs family wouldn’t come to grips with this fact until that fateful day. </p>

<p>Like with the Bays family and countless other families, kids across town arrived back home from school around 3:30pm that day. And so did Judy, Jack’s daughter who was in 7th grade at the time. </p>

<p> “All of us girls were going to take a bike ride around 4:30. Back then, you just rode. We were going to go to Sciotoville," Judy said.
It was a beautiful day. It was sunny, calm. Not even rainy or gloomy, nothing.” </p>

"It was a beautiful day. It was sunny, calm. Not even rainy or gloomy, nothing.” <em> (Side: Judy and Wilma sit on the couch in Jack's home.) </em> </p>

<p> Jack remembers the house smelling of strawberry rhubarb pie that Wilma was baking. He had just returned home from his job at a local insurance company when he looked outside and saw the neighborhood paperboy having a hard time. </p>

<p> “The paper boy was going down front, and all at once his papers were blown away. I looked across the street, and those shingles looked like they were raised up and getting ready to leave," Jack said. "My wife looked in the distance and said ‘there’s something a bad a coming.’” </p>

<p> Shingles were starting to rip off the roof and windows were starting to break. Wilma and Judy went downstairs while Jack remained upstairs, determined to see what was outside. </p> 

<p> “And my mom was saying ‘Jack, you better come down here.' I still wasn’t that scared, I mean, I didn’t know what it was," Judy said. "When he finally did come down, the windows started breaking up here. We still just thought it was a bad storm."

<p> The wind was so powerful, the glass sliding doors in the basement blew inward, falling onto the floor. </p>

<p> Within seconds, things turned for the worst. </p> 

<p> “The whole house was just lifted up from the basement floor. You could see air all around it and light," Judy said. "It just lifted and stayed there for awhile like a magic carpet. And the noise was like a train. And when it did that, Mom told me to shut my eyes, and she laid on top of me. The building’s hitting you but it didn’t hurt because of shock or something.” </p>

<p> “After the house left, it was just like death almost -- quietness. No birds, no nothing,” Jack said. </p>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px;"> <em> Above: The basement stairs the Riggs family used to escape the tornado. </em> </h5>

<p> “When it was done, like two or three seconds tops, the sky opened up. I said 'Mom, we’re going to go find Daddy. He’s dead,'" Judy said. "We didn’t cry or wail. She said ‘I know, sis'. I know, we have to find him.’” </p>

<p> Their home was gone. All that was left was the remaining rumble of their basement and the three of them, still alive. Their dog, Bozo, was dead in the neighborhood street. </p>

<p> Jack was walking down the street near Dogwood Ridge to check on other families when he heard one of his neighbors crying for help in the distance. </p>

<p> “I seen her coming across the field,” Jack said. “I said, 'where were your girls at Miss Underwood?' And she said ‘they were in the house, and I’d seen them blow away.’” </p>

<p> Barbara Underwood. The mother of two daughters, 15-year-old Linda Underwood and 10-year-old Brenda Underwood, who lived in a home five houses up from the Riggs family.
Fate would intertwine the two families that day. </p>

<h2> Sisters, Friends And Confidants </h2>

<img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/219yqdt.jpg" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;" />

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px;"> <em> Above: Barbara Underwood poses on her living room couch with pictures of her daughters from when they were younger: Brenda (left) and Linda (right) </em> </h5> 

<p> Linda was about three weeks from her 16th birthday, and according to Barbara, she was a social butterfly, always having friends over. For Brenda, who was more timid, Linda was her closest confidante. </p>

<p> "If Brenda had a problem, she’d go to her sister first. And I remember when the doctor told me that I needed to explain to Brenda the 'birds and the bees,' you know, to a degree anyway," Barbara said. "I told her the fundamentals and stuff. So, she went and told her sister ‘Mom’s flipped out.’ I guess she didn’t believe me.” </p>

<p> Around 4pm that day, Barbara was leaving the house to bring heart medicine to her dad across town. Brenda and Linda had just returned home from school, and Linda had plans to invite friends in a few hours. </p>

<p> She was driving east down Hammerstein Road went the rolling clouds began to darken. </p> 

<p> “And it got to looking so awful. I thought, 'what in the world is the matter?' And the wind had starting blowing and everything. Just a few feet on Dogwood Ridge Road, and the wind blew my car off into a ditch.” </p>

<p> Her car rammed into the ditch on the left-side of the road, her driver-side door jammed and badly damaged. 
Barbara managed to pry open the passenger-side door and sprint down the street toward her home. Her house was gone. </p> 

<p> Jack Riggs heard her cries for help. Along with his neighbor, Ernie Pyles, he found the rubble of Barbara’s home scattered across Dogwood Ridge Road and into an farm field. Jack found the two sisters amidst the rubble, with a downed telephone pole laying across them. With pure adrenaline, Jack and Ernie pulled the pole off them. </p>

<p> "We went up looking for the girls, and they both landed right beside one another. We found them laying in the rubble of the house. The oldest girl was bleeding really bad, and she was kinda red in her face, just blowing bubbles with that blood in her face," Jack said. "She just had quit all at once. She died while I was looking at her.” </p>

<p> The Bays family lost a some roofing. The Riggs family lost their home. The Underwood family lost Linda, their daughter. </p> 

<p> “I think in a different way. Like, I wonder how long it will be until I see her,” Barbara said. </p>

<p> "“I never said the lord brought through that tornado because that girl was a good christian girl. If the lord say and brought me back, I wonder how he never brought my daughter back. 
She was serving god too. I was in the path of the tornado, and I was just lucky that something never hit me,” Jack said. </p>

<p> An ambulance came to take Brenda and Linda to the hospital in nearby Portsmouth. Barbara and her husband, Dick, followed, unaware of what Jack had just witnessed. </p>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px;"> <em> Above: A picture of the Underwood family inside Barbara's home. </em> </h5>

<p> Brenda was in a coma and with her parents by her side,  was transported nearly 100 miles north to the Children’s Hospital in Columbus. </p>

<p> "She was unconscious for a long time -- around 70 days," Judy said. "I stayed up there with her, and there were times that there were friends that would come up and stay for a night." </p>

<p> Eventually, Brenda did wake up, only to find that her sister was no longer by her side. 
After months of mental and physical therapy, the only visible evidence of her ordeal were a couple of pencil-thin scars on her left cheek and a small circle of a scar on her throat from a tracheotomy to help her breath during her coma. </p>

<p> But after she returned home to Wheelersburg, her grief only intensified. </p>

<p> "She was out of school most of that next year. Toward the end of the school year, the doctor wanted her to go back," Judy said. "Of course, that was a bit different because she would come home upset a lot of times. She had to put up with a lot. There were the mean kids saying ‘you’re the tornado freak’ and things like that. They did that. You wouldn’t think they would, but they did.” </p>

<p> Dick has passed away, but both Brenda and her mother still live in the Wheelersburg area. 
Although Brenda declined to be interviewed for this podcast, Barbara shared with us how she’s found peace, and like so many others it’s through religion. </p>

<p> “You have to find that place. You have to find that place where you don’t just tolerate it. That it’s a part of what’s happened to you, and God’s not a mean person. He’s not doing things to get even with you," Barbara said. 
"He gave us the strength to get through it and do the best we could. You can’t undo things. You have to handle them the best way that you can." </p>

<p> It was the small things that helped the Underwood family as time went on. The food from neighbors, the support from extended family and a small dog named “Buttons.” </p>

<p> “People have a way, and there was times when it was kind of bad. There were other times that it would seem like something or someone made it a little bit easier. [Brenda's grandparents] brought her a Boston Terrier, and that dog can do everything but talk to you." </p>

<p> As the years went on after the tornado, Barbara asked Brenda about her scars. </p>

<p> "She had a scar on the side of her face and that tracheostomy, and I thought when she got a little bit older she’d want to have those fixed, you know? The doctor said 'I talked to her about it and she says 'they’re not bothering me If they’re bothering other people, that’s their problem.'' She never did have them fixed. But as she’s gotten older, it’s not as noticable.” </p>

<p> For the Riggs family, even imagining  the Underwoods’ struggle gave them a new perspective on how they treated each other. They lost their home and belongings in a moment of time, but that was all. Three months later and their home was rebuilt. </p>

<p> "You just realize how fast [your belongings] can go. Especially Mom to lay down and protect me, after I had children I knew in my heart how much my mom loved me, how you’d do that to protect them, you know," Judy said. </p>

<p> “When I’d seen them, we were talking with them across the street about what we’d lost and all. Mr. Underwood said ‘you guys didn’t lose nothing. You can build yours back, but I can’t build mine back," Jack said. </p>
