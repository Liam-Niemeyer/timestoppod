<div class="story-format">

<p> It was a brisk fall day in Grove City, Ohio, a Franklin County suburb of Columbus. John Bays arrives home with his mother, Naomi, and his teenage daughter, who is holding a large mailed envelope.</p>

<p> “And she just got a letter from Capital University she’s been waiting for. She’s getting all excited," Bays said. </p>

<p> Bays is a large man with a soft-spoken voice, his black-rimmed glasses square on his face above his gray mustache. 
Even though right now he’s thinking about the future and his daughter soon going to college, his past has a way of sneaking back into his head. 
Specifically, his hometown: Wheelersburg, Ohio. </p>

<p> “I used to remember we had no traffic lights as a kid. And I remember by the time I got into high school, they put a traffic light on Old Gallia and Center street." 
And I couldn’t believe we had a traffic light," Bays said. "I think they’re graduating about 180, 190 a class now. When I graduated in ‘82, it was about only 89.” </p>

<p> The ‘Burg, as locals like to call. 
A small town along the Ohio River on the southern tip of the state. A town, where, unfortunately at times for Bays and his younger brother, Robert, everyone knew everybody. </p>

<p> “I remember when I got older when I was seven or eight years old, I couldn’t do anything wrong in the neighborhood without somebody telling my mom ‘you know what Johnnie and Roberts’ been doing." </p>

<p> He has mostly fond memories of his hometown. He played on the football team coached by local legend Ed Miller, who in 1989 brought the town a state championship. 
He still keeps in touch with classmates he graduated with. </p> 

<p> But when one mentions a specific day, a specific time, emotions come rushing back. </p> 

<p> That is April 23, 1968. 4:05pm. </p>

<p> “And I can remember it clear as day, my Grandma convinced that is was God that kept the tree from falling through in her house. 
And the branches tugging at the gutters. So that’s what she believed in. 
And I grew up believing it too because Grandma’s right, you know. 
So like I told you the other time we talked, if her house had been smashed, we wouldn’t have a place to live. 
Who would have known what our childhood would have been like if we had to move to another town. 
Had her house been crushed, anything could have happened….and we were the lucky ones.” </p>

<h2> A Hometown, Hidden In The Hills </h2>

<p> For many Americans, 1968 was turbulent and destructive. 
Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4th that year and the Tet Offensive in Vietnam had continued to smolder.  
But in a small place like Wheelersburg, it was a community relatively unaffected by the outside world -- Surrounded by rolling hills, away from everything else. </p>

<p> “There were a couple of grocery stores, William’s Furniture and the doughnut shop that was on center-street in the ‘Burg. And, of course, there was Pop’s Drive-In and Restaurant. 
My mother worked there for years. I was a carhop there for awhile," Bays' mother, Naomi, said. </p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/rc1wkm.jpg" alt="" /></span>Naomi and her extended family and mother all lived in a modest, ranch-style home on Granite Street near downtown Wheelersburg. <em> (Side: Naomi sits in the living room of John Bays' home.) </em></p>

<p> “Well, it was the 50s and the 60s, and rock and roll was a big hit. 
Muscle cars were a big hit. It was just a small town atmosphere," Donna, Naomi's sister, said. "Practically everybody knew each other. 
There wasn’t much in Wheelersburg back then.” </p>

<p> Donna was a high-school senior working at the most popular, and only, restaurant in town, Pop’s Drive-In and Restaurant. It was the de facto gathering place for the town. </p>

<p> “There was a dine-in area, and then there was drive-thru there. I was a carhop there from 66’ to 68,’ and they had french fries, french fries with gravy, burgers, hot dogs, hot dog sauce, pies, cobblers -- everything was made from scratch. Nothing was pre-prepared," Donna said. </p>

<p> April 27, 1968 started like any normal day for Donna. It was finally springtime, and the trees and flowers were just starting to bud. </p>

<p> "I had to walk home because I lived within a half-mile of the high school. 
We were walking home, and the sky was looking weird," Donna said. "We thought it was just gonna be a storm coming. The clouds were sorta rolling, and it was sorta like turning dark." </p>

<p> Donna arrived back home on Granite Street where Naomi was doing laundry. 
Four-year-old John and his brother, Robert, were chasing each other in the living room. 
Her mom, Hazel, a cook at Pop’s restaurant, hadn’t come home from work yet. </p>

<p> “I called my boyfriend’s mother while we were on the phone, and the sky outside was getting darker and darker. Static was coming on the phone, so we got off," Donna said. "I saw the wind blowing really hard.” </p>

<p> “I had three little kids, done laundry and my mother and I saw that the wind was blowing the rain sideways," Naomi said. "I went outside to get the laundry, and I happened to look in front of me to see there was roofing swirling in front of me. 
I put those clean clothes over my head and dashed to the house to make sure the kids were good." </p>

<p> "Johnny and Robert started crying real hard. 
They were crying so hard, and they were pointing at the front door. A tree had come down and come through the porch roof. This big tree was laying right there on the front door,” Donna said. </p>

<p> Donna and Naomi scrambled to get the crying kids in their small basement before things turned worse. </p>

<p> “And that’s when all heck broke loose. Shingles went flying off the house. There was no tree after another was flying, and so the phone service went out," Donna said. </p>

<h2> 'Like A Bomb Went Off' </h2>

<p> Their home was still intact -- somehow. A small sapling fell on the side of their house, and a larger 40-foot tree had crashed through their front porch, branches dangling through the broken window. 
Shingles and debris lay in the yard. 
Although the five family members were unharmed, the status of family members, including their mother, was unknown. </p>

<p> "Well, [I told my sister] I’m going to walk over and check on Mom. And I was walking over, people were stopping and saying that a funnel cloud came across Kentucky, across the Ohio River," Donna said. </p>

<p> It was a tornado, and it was a big one. 
The Wheelersburg tornado as it’s historically known was rated an F5 on the Fujita scale, the strongest rating that could be issued at that time, with estimated gusts of at least 261 miles per hour. 
Winds that carry entire houses. The tornado cut a 400-yard-wide path up Dogwood Ridge road, splitting the town in half. One side of the ridge, houses were intact. People who lived on the other side weren't so lucky. </p> 

<p> “I remember when I saw the ridge, it was like a bomb had gone off. The houses were just obliterated, wood and stuff laying here and there," Donna said. "They had found stuff blown in the woods that the tornado blew quite a distance and stuff." </p>

<p> Over 500 homes were damaged or completely gone. 92 people were injured. The wind had overturned ten train cars off the nearby tracks, tossing another car into a ditch. 
It’s rumored that people even witness the tornado part the Ohio River like Moses, exposing the Ohio riverbed. </p>

<p> As Donna walked, ambulances were wailing in the distance and massive trees blocked the road. Donna reluctantly turned back home, but she was greeted by the first piece of happy news. </p>

<p> “By then, mom had made it home. She didn’t know how we were. It was a welcome homecoming that evening," Naomi said. </p>

<p> Yet there were still family members unaccounted for. This was the late 60s. Cellphones didn’t exist. 
And their sister, Ruth, their mother-in-law, Grandma Baldridge, and their nephews and nieces lived up along Dogwood Ridge. </p>

<p>They couldn’t sleep that night.</p>

<p> "We spent the whole night worrying because things were pretty unstable. And it was the first thing we thought of when Mom made us get up and get dressed to have breakfast," Naomi said. </p>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px;"> <em> Above: Another undated picture of the tornado damage. (Credit - Minford Local Schools) </em> </h5>

<p> Donna and Naomi in nothing but petal-pusher overalls decided to trek four miles up through devastated streets to Dogwood Ridge to check on family. They had to. </p>

<p> But there was a problem. </p>

<p> “People were coming up from other towns trying to loot the stores, the few stores we had in the ‘Burg. So martial law was enforced. The national guard came in. We weren’t even allowed to leave our neighborhoods," Donna said. </p>

<p> Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes had dispatched the Ohio National Guard that night to ward off looters, blocking off streets. No one could get in or out. </p>

<p> “We were scared to death for those kids and everything. It kind of made us mad that they wouldn’t let us go and check on the kids and everything," Naomi said. 
"You could definitely tell they were in the military, and they were serious at their job. And we were serious about what we planned on doing, too. Do not mess with the Finn girls.” </p>

<p> Donna and Naomi knew the local hills and woods from playing in them as kids -- they took a gamble. They decided to sneak around the National Guard, by cutting through a creek near an auto repair garage a few blocks west from their home. </p>

<p> "We were walking along side the creek. Well, we thought we gotta sort of stay quiet and not let the national guard see us. They would have hauled us right back home," Donna said. </p>

<p> They cut through the creek, the cold water up to their knees. All the while, soldiers were patrolling the streets above. Eventually, they reached the ridge close to Grandma Baldridge’s home. </p>

<p> They thought their fears were realized. </p>

<p> “We got there and there was no house there. Everything was just gone," Naomi said. "And so we really were frightened that something had gone wrong.
You thought the worst. You thought, ‘oh my god, Grandma Baldridge and the kids are gone.' It makes my heart beat faster right now. It was sheer devastation. That’s why we were so young and had a lot of vim and vigor, that hill was nothing compared to what we were feeling on the inside.” </p>

<p> The two turned around to try to get to their sister Ruth’s place farther east along where Dogwood Ridge and Hammerstein Road met. But the woods were all gone with this path. There was nowhere to hide. </p>

<p> “We went on home and of course we couldn’t tell any good news. There was nothing, the house was gone. And our imagination was running wild, you know," Naomi said. </p>

<p> They had no idea whether Ruth, Mrs. Baldridge or any of the nieces and nephews were still alive. 
For the second night in a row, they went to bed terrified of the prospect that their family may be dead. </p>

<p> Ruth, Mrs. Baldridge, and the nieces and nephews did end up making it: Wayne, a brother, had a farm farther in the countryside that they were safely at. </p>

<p> “We were lucky. We were in the right part of the ‘Burg. Our shingles got blown off. 
Trees were down, across the streets and everything," Donna said. "But we were lucky where we were at, because the houses on the right side of Dogwood Ridge, they weren’t even touched. But right across the road, the subdivisions were just destroyed.” </p>

<p> The town slowly started to rebuild its broken homes and broken identity. It had lost seven people during the storm, and every year during the anniversary of the tornado, John Bays would listen to his youth pastor’s sad account of being unable to save one of those who died. 
At the Cornerstone Church of the Nazarene, Sunday School Teacher Jack Riggs would tell his story. </p>

<p> I had never really realized to the extent what Jack had gone through. He had told some stories about saving that one person, but I didn’t know that there was someone that wasn’t saved," John Bays said. "But when he would tell his story every year or when he did, you could hear it in his voice what it meant to him and how it had affected him. 
He was just one heck of a man.” </p>
