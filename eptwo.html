<p> After that game, Dick wanted another shot. But the Pilots wouldn’t be giving him a longer look, a good look, after all. </p>

<p> “And then the next day we went on the road and went to Minnesota. 
I was there for about a week and a half with them. They never did give me enough shot to pitch.," Dick said. 
"They sent me back down to Vancouver to Triple AAA ball. And I mean, it was tough on me going back down. 
I thought I would [go back up], but I never did. And I didn’t know if Schultz had something against me. 
You never know the reasoning behind some of the stuff that’s done in baseball.” </p>

<p> The Seattle Pilots in their first year were run by general manager Marvin Milkes, who had served as GM for multiple minor league teams before. 
Although it’s hard to say exactly why Bates was sent back down, Milkes’ intense win-first mindset certainly offers insight. </p>

<p> “He wanted to win badly, which is not a good trait for a general manager of an expansion team," Bill Mullens who wrote the book “Becoming Big League” about the Pilots, said. 
"So he was always looking for the combination of players that he thought would win. 
And he was pretty critical of the players that he thought weren’t trying really hard.” </p>

<p> The Pilots set a then record for having the most players go through a 25-man roster, with 53 players. </p>

<p> “What I noticed is that I had a quotation from some of the snarkier players saying ‘Well, it seems like the bus from Vancouver drives in every night to take some of us back to Vancouver.’ 
Because the turnover was just really terrific,” Mullens said. </p>

<p> Bates was another gear in that turnover in which he had no say in. But the fact he didn’t get another shot wouldn’t matter soon enough. In Vancouver, his luck turned south. </p>

<p> “I was pitching up in Vancouver, and I heard it pop when I threw it. 
And they gave me cortisone shots and stuff, but it never did come back right. 
Everytime I tried to throw hard, it was like someone taking a hot iron going down my arm. 
It was a deltoid muscle," Dick said. </p>

<p> Dick told his dad shortly after it happened. </p>

<p> “He took it pretty hard. But he understands injuries. It happens. I went to spring training and I just couldn’t throw right. So I got out of baseball. I had a couple of Giants try to get me back and play, but I wasn’t throwing the way I should. 
I wasn’t going to go and throw knuckleballs and stuff like that," Dick said. </p>

<p> Dick bowed out of baseball in 1970, and coincidentally, so did the Seattle Pilots. 
The Pilots were in dire financial footing by the end of the 1969 season, with a deal being struck with Milwaukee businessman Bud Selig during the first game of the World Series to buy the Seattle Pilots. 
Local efforts to keep the team in Seattle failed, and during the spring of 1970, trucks with the team’s equipment were heading up to Milwaukee to eventually become the Milwaukee Brewers. </p>

<p> It was the end of the road for Seattle’s one-year-old MLB team, but Bate’s journey was just beginning. </p> 

<h2> A Pitcher's Legacy </h2>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px;"> <em> Above: A snippet of one of the few baseball cards featuring Dick Bates, with his signature adorning the front. </em> </h5>

<p> Now that Dick's life as a pitcher was over, he searched for a new career. Lucky for him, the connections he made in baseball came through -- 
he had a powerful friend in the resort business out in Phoenix. </p>

<p> “JW Marriott, who I met when I was with the Washington Senators, was the one who got me into the resort business, into golf. 
I went to work at the Camelback Inn golf course. And I still thank him for giving me a shot at that,” Dick said. </p>

<p> When you ask Dick whether he wishes he would have stayed in the Majors, he actually says no. </p>

<p> “If I had stayed in, it would have probably changed everything I’ve done. Meeting my wife, and we’ve been married for 45 years. You think about it, and if I would have not come here when I did, what would I be doing now? Who knows? 
Everything follows into order as you go along, and meeting the right person. 
And that’s what life’s about. It’s meeting people. My old saying is, ‘it’s not what you know, it’s who you know.’ 
Everything I got here, I’m happy,” Dick said. </p>

<p> Austin Bates passed away in 1984, Zella in 1991. 
Dick’s brother, Daniel, passed away two years ago. 
They’re all buried in Elk Cemetery on the northside of McArthur. 
Whenever Dick reminisces about baseball, Austin comes to mind. </p>

<p> “I think about him all the time still. I think about him a lot, my dad. He was from little league all the way up from even the pro ball stuff, he was always there for me. 
Like I said, he used to catch me all the way through high school. 
Especially as a senior, as you get older you kind of want to do other stuff, but he kept me in line and we’d throw about every day," Dick said. </p>

<p> Dick still gets assorted envelopes and packages of fan mail each month from people across the country, especially Seattle, who remember him. But he never got anything from McArthur until one day. </p>

<p> "I got a letter about three, four years ago from this guy named Rob Timms, and after I had played ball and left he had started playing ball. Our house was right by the park there," Dick said. 
"My dad had started going over and watching them practice, and then he started working with this kid. So, he wrote me a letter about it. He played high school ball in Vinton County in the 80s. 
He played on the high school team and played on the American Legion team and stuff.” </p>

<p> 56-year-old Rob Timms still lives in McArthur. 
A Pittsburgh Pirates ball cap covers his gray and balding head, putting a shadow over his friendly face. 
He’s one of the few McArthur natives that still remembers the story of Dick Bates. </p>

<h5 style="display: block; width: 80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 10px;"> <em> Above: One of the customized baseball cards Rob Timms made of Dick Bates. </em> </h5>

<p> Timms’ father worked with Austin at the local powder plant, so Timms knew about how Austin coached Dick to baseball fame. 
After one practice, Austin walked up to Timms and asked if he could help Timms out. </p>

<p> “And I would always hang out after with him, and he would always help me on my swing. And I spent a lot of time with him," Timms said. "He would take me over to his house, and he would show him the shine he had for Dick in his basement. But not a lot of people knew who he was, or what he did.” </p>

<p> Timms’ appreciation for Dick’s story went beyond high school. He even had custom baseball cards made of Dick for the year 1969 because companies like Topp’s never made one. 
When he sent his letter three years ago and never heard a response, he put it to the back of his mind. </p>

<p> “Usually when people write to baseball players, they’re writing to request this or that, or get a signature or whatever, and I don’t think I did that in the letter," Timms said. 
"I just wanted to make contact, and wasn’t really asking for anything. It was a sincere letter.” </p>

  <em>(phone is ringing)</em>
		
  Dick: This is Dick.
		
  Liam: Hey, Dick. This is Liam. I have Rob here 
  with me, he’s the guy that wrote you the letter.

  D: How are things back in McArthur?

  Rob: Nothing ever changes in this ole’ place. 

  D: (laughs)

  R: I was really surprised to hear you kept 
  that letter, it really surprised me when Liam 
  told me that.

  D: I was gonna call you when I got the 
  letter, but I got busy and stuff. 
  But I got it on my desk at work. I get a lot 
  of letters to autograph and stuff, and I 
  usually don’t keep them. But yours, I did.

  R: I appreciate it. I spent a lot of time 
  with your dad. 
  He helped me with baseball after practice
  and told me stories, and I really 
  appreciated him…..I thought 
  a lot of your dad. He spent a lot of 
  time helping me when I played baseball 
  after practice and told me stories.

  D: Yea, he was a good man.

  <em>(LN)
  I’m sitting here in the local library in 
  downtown McArthur with Timms, who’s 
  talking with Dick for the first time. 
  You can tell they both grew 
  up in McArthur.</em>

  R: I don’t know if Reedy’s market was here 
  when you were younger, going out route 
  50 out of town. 

  D: Yea, Reedy’s?

  R: Well I grew up in the little 
  Thompson addition street right 
  alongside Reedy’s.

  D: Oh did you really? 

  R: And matter of fact, my sister-in-law 
  is in your old house right now. 

  D: You’re kidding me.

  R: No.

  D: That’s amazing.

  <em>(LN)
  The letter was a reminder for Dick that 
  someone remembered him. Someone 
  remembered his father. Someone remembered 
  he made it to the Majors. 
  April 27, 1969.</em>

  D: I think about McArthur a lot, it was a 
  great place to grow up, and it probably 
  still is. 

  R: As I said, I left for a year, and I 
  decided to actually move our family back. 
  As I said, this is where I plan on staying. 
  Do you have any plans on making it back to here? 

  D: I probably will. If I do, I’ll look you up. 
  I’ll give you a call….I’ll probably try to get 
  back here sometime in the 
  summertime because my brother recently 
  passed away, and Bonna is still back here.

  R: Well, I sure appreciate that, and I sure 
  appreciate talking to you. 
  Thought a lot of your dad, always wanted you to know that. 

  D: Yep, I think about him a lot sometimes. 

  R: I’m sure you do. 

  D: But I appreciate your interest in me, Rob. In my dad. 

  R: I appreciate your dad, and I’m thrilled to talk with you. 
  And maybe this summer we can get together.
